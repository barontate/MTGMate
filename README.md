hey babes

when you run the mtgmate checker, it should open a little window to type your detials into, and select the collection.
you can select if you want it to subtract a number from cards to sell, for example if you want to keep 1 of each card, and attempt to sell the rest.
when you push go, it should open a chrome window, go to mtgmate and log you in. it should then search for a test card (Black Lotus).
if it gets this far then it should (*should*) be safe to leave it running - you can use your pc and it will still work in the background.

there is a progress bar to tell you how far through your collection it is, and info telling you how fast it is going.
once it is done, you can open mtgmate in your normal browser and all the cards you supposedly have will be in the buylist cart, they should all be there unless you delete your cookies or use incognito mode or whatever.
remove the ones you do not want to sell and then complete the sale. can compare with the output.csv that is generated.



NOTES:
seems to only work if you use chrome! (need chrome installed at least). if you get an error saying that it is unable to find a driver for chrome, open this link: https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/134.0.6998.35/win64/chrome-win64.zip and extract it to the folder where the code is. run the setup.exe and hopefully that fixes it
technically according to mtgmates back-end notes, bot trawling is not allowed, but they havent seemed to block it at all - so use it at your own risk i guess?
sometimes when logging in, the reCaptcha catches the bot. in my experience, just try it again and it more often than not, doesnt catch the bot.
try not to click inside the browser window as it is running, it might cause it to crash. it *shouldnt*, as ive set up error catchers, but just to be safe.
the code should automatically stop if you reach the maximum buylist order of 300 cards. the program will pause and wait for you to complete the order, then you can push OK and it will begin a new one.
